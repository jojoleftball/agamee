MERGE GARDEN - MOBILE-FIRST GAME DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
========================================================

COMPLETED TASKS:
----------------
✅ 1. Basic project structure setup (React + TypeScript + Vite)
✅ 2. Game state management with Zustand (resources, board, garden, dialogues)
✅ 3. Loading screen with progress bar
✅ 4. Dialogue system with Maria & Soly characters (4 dialogue lines)
✅ 5. World map screen with main garden ENTER button + locked gardens
✅ 6. Garden screen with 12 planting slots
✅ 7. Merge board screen with 6x5 grid layout
✅ 8. Plant data system (10 plant types: Rose, Tulip, Sunflower, Daisy, Violet, Lily, Orchid, Marigold, Poppy, Peony)
✅ 9. Plant progression system (4-5 ranks per plant)
✅ 10. Tool system (Water Bucket, Seed Bag with 3 ranks each)
✅ 11. Generator system (Rose Generator, Tool Box)
✅ 12. ItemSprite component for rendering plants/tools
✅ 13. PlantCareModal for watering/feeding plants
✅ 14. PlantingModal for planting final-rank flowers
✅ 15. TutorialOverlay component
✅ 16. Resource management UI (coins, energy, gems, XP)
✅ 17. Plant care meters (water/seed meters with decay)
✅ 18. Basic merge logic utility functions

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:
-----------------------
❌ 1. Merge mechanics NOT working - dragging items doesn't merge them
❌ 2. Generator tap functionality NOT implemented
❌ 3. Plant withering system NOT updating in real-time
❌ 4. No visual feedback for valid merge combos
❌ 5. No merge animations/particles
❌ 6. Energy regeneration system NOT active
❌ 7. XP bar/level display missing
❌ 8. Tutorial system NOT functional (steps don't advance)
❌ 9. Tasks/quests system NOT implemented
❌ 10. Storage system UI NOT functional

HIGH PRIORITY TASKS (NEXT):
---------------------------
🔨 1. FIX MERGE MECHANICS - Make 3-to-1 merging actually work with proper drag detection
🔨 2. ADD MERGE ANIMATIONS - Pop effects, particles, sound feedback
🔨 3. IMPLEMENT GENERATOR TAP - Click generator to produce items with cooldown
🔨 4. FIX PLANT CARE - Auto-decay meters, withering warnings, visual indicators
🔨 5. ADD HIGHLIGHT SYSTEM - Show which items can merge (green glow on matching items)
🔨 6. CREATE TASK SYSTEM - "Merge 3 roses", "Plant 1 flower" with rewards
🔨 7. ADD ENERGY REGEN - Auto-regenerate energy over time (1 per 30 seconds)
🔨 8. BUILD STORAGE UI - Modal to view/retrieve 10 stored items
🔨 9. ADD SOUND EFFECTS - Background music, merge sound, plant sound, UI clicks
🔨 10. CREATE XP BAR - Visual progress bar showing level progression

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
---------------
⏺ 11. Tutorial flow automation (guide through first merge → plant → care)
⏺ 12. Special events system (birthday bonus)
⏺ 13. Unlock system for additional gardens (Tropical, Zen, Desert, Winter)
⏺ 14. Store panel (buy energy, gems, special items)
⏺ 15. Achievement system
⏺ 16. Daily rewards
⏺ 17. Improved mobile touch handling (better drag zones)
⏺ 18. Performance optimization (object pooling for particles)

POLISH & QA:
-----------
🎨 19. Responsive layout testing (various phone sizes)
🎨 20. Smooth transitions between screens
🎨 21. Loading states for async operations
🎨 22. Error handling and user feedback
🎨 23. Save/load state persistence
🎨 24. Plant grow-in animations
🎨 25. Particle effects for merging
🎨 26. Haptic feedback (vibration on merge)

CURRENT FOCUS:
--------------
NOW WORKING ON: Fixing merge mechanics and making the core gameplay loop functional

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix drag-and-drop merge detection (currently items don't merge when dragged together)
2. Add visual highlighting for valid merge combinations
3. Implement generator tap functionality with cooldowns
4. Add merge success animations and rewards feedback
5. Create functional task system to guide player progression
